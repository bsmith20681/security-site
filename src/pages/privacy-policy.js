              "<strong>Service</strong>" means all of the services provided by
              Your Home Security Expert, including but not limited to all
              Content, services, and products available through the Website.
              Your Home Security Expert is not a financial advisor, and all
              forms of financial advice or financial services are explicitly
              excluded from the Service. "<strong>User</strong>," “
              <strong>you</strong>” and “<strong>your</strong>” refer to the
              person, company, or organization that has visited or is using our
              Website and/or our Service.

            <p>
              <strong>Information We Collect and Store</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Your Home Security Expert will not use any information to contact
              you for any reason unrelated to your use of the Website. We will
              not provide this contact information to any third party. We will
              not use your confidential information for any commercial reason
              unrelated to the Website. Your Home Security Expert only collects
              information that you choose to provide voluntarily, by using the
              Website. To learn about your user experience and to make periodic
              improvements to the Website, we also collect the information
              regularly collected by web browsers. We will automatically record
              information and your activity. This may include your Internet
              Protocol (“IP”) address, country, city, browser type, the web page
              visited before you came to our website, information you search for
              on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers
              associated with your devices, your mobile carrier, date and time
              stamps, system configuration information, metadata concerning your
              files, and other interactions with the Service. We also use
              “cookies” to collect information and improve our Service. A cookie
              is a small data file that we transfer to your device. We may use
              “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to
              better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor
              aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. However,
              none of this is associated with you as an individual. It is
              measured only in aggregate. Cookies do not capture your individual
              email address or any private information about you. You can
              instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting
              cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the
              websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may
              not be able to use all aspects of our website.

              <strong>How We Use Your Information</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We use your information only for purposes of facilitating your use
              of our webpage and to assist us in improving our service. We do
              not use your information for any additional or unrelated
              commercial purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Surveys</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              From time to time, Your Home Security Expert may conduct surveys
              via the Website. If you choose to participate, we use your
              response to come up with the survey results and, sometimes, to
              publish those results in aggregate on the site. We will never
              permanently record or report any response you give on its own or
              connect it to your name or address. We will hold these responses
              only as anonymous statistics. We will never sell or rent such
              information to any third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Email, Mailing Lists, and Other Services</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              When you send us an email through the
              <strong>Contact Form</strong> or the
              <strong>Issues or Concerns Form</strong>
              provided, we use your email address to thank you for your comment
              and/or reply to your question, and we will store your
              communication and our reply in case we correspond further. Beyond
              our initial reply, we will never use your email address to send
              you any unsolicited message or information, nor will we share it
              with or sell it to anyone else for such use. When you request
              information or other services, we use your email address and any
              other information you give us to provide you with the information
              or other services you requested until you ask us to stop (using
              the “unsubscribe” instructions provided with each email and/or on
              the site where you signed up and/or as we otherwise provide), or
              until the information or service is no longer available. We will
              not use your address or other information to provide you with any
              unsolicited message or information (unless that is part of the
              service you are requesting), nor will we share it with or sell,
              rent or lease it to any third party for such use.
