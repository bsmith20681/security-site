## What is Vivint's Monthly Price?

Their basic security plan starts at $39 including the equipment. Their next package up includes security and home automation starts at around $49 per month with equipment. If you get a two camera system with security then it will be around $59 a month equipment. If you want all the bells and whistles that Vivint has to offer, the most you will pay will be around $99 per month.

Vivint's pricing works like a cell phone plan. They bundle the cost of the security equipment with the cost of their service. For example, their basic plan is actually $29 a month for monitoring and they require that you buy their Vivint starter kit at $599 which breaks down to $10 a month financed at 0% APR for up to 60 months. The starter kit includes the panel, 3 door sensors, and a motion sensor.

In order to calculate your price, you will decide which equipment you want and determine the monthly service fee based on those features. Then you will add the equipment cost together. Start with the $599 starter kit which includes the panel, 3 door sensors, and a motion sensor. Next add together the other equipment that you want. For example, if you want two outside cameras and a door lock it will be a total of $977. 

<div align="center"><strong>$399 (2 outdoor cameras) + $179 Door Lock = $977</strong></div>

Then add that cost with the starter kit fee and divide by 42 or 60 months. These are the two financing options that Vivint gives us. For those who qualify it is at 0% APR. They say that you need a credit score of a 680 or higher to qualify for this. 

<div align="center"><strong>$599 (starter kit) + $977 (additional equipment) = $1,576 (total equipment fee)</strong></div>

<div align="center"><strong>$1,576 / 60 (Finance length) = $26.26</strong></div>

<div align="center"><strong>Monthly bill is $75.26</strong></div>

<div align="center"><strong>($49.99 service fee plus $26.26 equipment fee)</strong></div>

## Does Vivint have a Contract?

You might be thinking why would I buy the equipment when other companies just offer it for free? In reality, no company offers "free equipment". If you read the fine print, it is actually being bundled up into the price. This is why they require a 3 year contract. This is why they can make their money back. 

Vivint does not have a service agreement. This means that you can cancel at any time without having to pay a buyout fee. The only cost to cancel would just be the remaining balance on your equipment.  Once the equipment is paid off then you are month to month. 

**Final Thoughts**

Vivintâ€™s cost will be a lot more when compared to other companies such as Simpli Safe and Cove. However, they have the highest quality of equipment compared to their competitors. Their system is extremely fluid in the way that it works with very little errors. When you compare them feature for feature Vivint is the top of the line. As a result, they are going to cost more than their other companies. 

If you want similar features, then ADT would be a good second option. They can offer similar equipment with good enough quality at a lower rate. If you are really trying to get a lower rate, I would recommend checking out a DIY system. They will always have the lowest rates, but the quality of equipment will not be the same. However, for some people that is all they need.
