Cameras are always the most requested item when it comes to home security. If a breakin or piece of property were to get stolen, having the video evidence is the best way to try and find the person who did it and get your stuff back. I have seen countless videos of packages being stolen from the front door step only to find the guilty person a few days later thanks to the police. High quality camera video, night vision, and the ability to download and share the video are all crucial features in today’s world.

The problem with most cameras is the installation. Not only do you need to get on a ladder to mount the camera, but then you have to run wires all the way to the attic to plug them into an electric outlet. This can make the process super daunting for anyone who hasn't done it before.

Thankfully, there are plenty of options nowadays for cameras that just run off batteries. The cameras I will be going over in this article don’t need to be plugged into anything. They are all wireless. You will simply mount the camera and occasionally charge the batteries and that is it!
This article will only cover cameras powered by batteries that you have to recharge on your own.

## Arlo Outside Cameras

**Best for remote locations without wifi**

- No wifi required for video streaming
- 1080p video
- Free 7 day video recordings
- Two way talk
- Battery lasts 3 months
- Night Vision
- Alerts sent to phone
- Weather proof

Arlo is the best fit for anyone who is trying to install their camera in a remote location that doesn’t have wifi. Their camera has the ability to connect to 4G LTE and stream all of it’s live video through the cell towers. It does require a mobile phone plan since it is using LTE to stream it’s video. This can be accomplished by visiting a verizon store. If you just want to mount these to your home then you will just use your wifi and there is no cost for that.

This camera comes fully loaded with a 1080p lens. This gives you crystal clear video to be able to easily detect whatever is going one. The camera does come equipped with night vision which makes seeing the dark possible. On top of that, you have the ability to talk with whoever is on the other end of the camera. Using the app on your smartphone, you can hear and talk to people through the camera. The same is true for the person in front of the camera. They are able to talk back. This feature is called two-way talk. It can be a great deterrent if you have someone walking around your property looking through windows.

Once you download the app on your smartphone, you can pop in and see whatever is happening in real time and any moment. If you miss a moment, then you can go back and see any previously recorded video clips. The recordings are free for up to 7 days. This means that whenever there is motion in front of the camera then it will start to record. So it will only record in clips and save those clips for up to 7 days for free. If you want to have a continuous recording then you need to pay for that.

**How much is it for recording?**

As I stated before, any clip recorded within the past 7 days is free. If you want to have continuous recording for up to 14 days then it is $14.99 per month. If you want even more, you can get up to 30 days of recording for $19.99 per month. I would recommend starting off with the free version and save any clips to your computer that you think would be necessary. For example, if someone broke into your home, you would want to save that video to be able to show to the police department later.

Overall the Arlo Camera is a solid choice for anyone who is needing to install their camera in a remote location. If you want to see what packages they have you can check it out here.

## Blink Outside Camera

**Most Affordable**

- Wifi Required for video streaming
- 2 year battery life
- Most affordable camera
- Mobile alerts to phone
- Weatherproof

Many companies are recognizing the need and want for easy to install battery powered cameras. This includes Amazon. Recently Amazon acquired their own outside camera called Blink. This camera is the most affordable camera that is on the market right now. You can pick up a camera for only $99. This includes one camera along with it’s hub. Then each additional camera is only $69.

My favorite part about this camera is the small compact design. It is small and black which makes it very discreet. This can help give you a chance of catching the person since they are less likely to notice it.

Just because the camera is small and affordable doesn’t mean it doesn’t pack a punch! The camera quality in this small camera is a full 1080p. You can easily see what is going on with this camera. You also have night vision too. So even if it is pitch black outside, you can still see what is going on. Just like all cameras now, you can download the app on your phone and see what is going on in real time. Any moment there is someone approaching the camera, the motion sensor built inside of the lens will alert you on your phone. And, of course, you can talk to them too. Inside is a built in microphone which gives you the ability to talk to them through it just like a doorbell camera.

**How long does Blink outdoor camera battery last for?**

The astonishing part about this camera is the battery life. It will last up to 2 years before it needs to be changed out! As far as I know, this is the longest lasting battery life for an outdoor camera.

## Logitech Circle Camera

**Widest Angle Lens**

- Widest angle camera lens
- Wifi Required for video streaming
- 30-90 days battery life
- Mobile alerts to phone
- Weatherproof
- 1080p
- Night vision
- Two way talk

Sometimes less is more. The Logitech Circle 2 camera proves this to be true by coming equipped with a 180 degree lens! This one of the widest angle lens cameras on the market. A wide angle lens means you can see a lot more with just one camera. In some cases this one camera can see what normally only two would be able to see. This can help prevent the expenses of having to buy extra cameras.

The camera quality is also excellent. You can expect to receive a full 1080p resolution video. Just like the other cameras, it is fully night vision as well. So at any time, day or night, you are covered. Similar to its competitors, you can converse with people through the camera via it’s two way talk feature. It is a great way to make it look like you are home even if you are away. It is important to note that wifi is required for all the features to be available on your phone.

[The camera costs $129, but there are refurbished ones on amazon for only $84.](https://amzn.to/33w9lI5)

**How long does the battery last?**

The battery has three different modes. Each mode will depend on how long the camera battery lasts, but it will last between 30-90 days. The most conservative mode will only try to record about two clips a day and will allow the camera to last for 90 days. If you run the camera as normal then the battery will only last 30.

##Is there a monthly cost?\*\*

There is a free plan which allows you to keep recording from the past 24 hours. If you want to have 14 days worth of recordings then it is $3.99 per month for one camera. You can upgrade up to 5 cameras for $6.99 per month. The final plan is to keep the last 30 days worth of recordings and that costs $9.99 for a single camera and $17.99 per month for up to 5 cameras. This plan is more expensive than other competitors out there.

Some people are really against the monthly price that comes with today’s services. I don’t blame them, it can add up after a while.

The other features are what you would come to expect by now. The camera has a 1080p lens with night vision. The mobile alerts are sent to your phone so you can know when someone is approaching the home. The great part is that you can set up a zone where it will only alert you if someone walks through that zone.
