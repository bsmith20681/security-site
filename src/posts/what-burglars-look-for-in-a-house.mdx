If you know what burglars are looking for beforehand it can make things a lot easier to prepare for a breakin. In this article, I cover the top items the burglars steam when they break into a home. I also cover how to hide them and prevent future break ins.

## What do Burglars Look for in a House?

Burglars often look for jewelry, cash, drugs, guns, clothing, and small electronics when they break into a home. They want things that are quick and easy. Bigger items such as tvs are difficult to carry without getting caught. Smaller items, such as prescription drugs, carry a lot of value on the street and can be concealed easier.

## 1. Jewelry

Jewelry is small and worth a lot of money. This is why it is one of the most common items to be stolen. It is easy to find too. Most people keep their jewelry in their room or bathroom.

This gives burglars an easy place to look. Since jewelry is so small, you can simply hide it in a coat pocket. This makes it easy to hide and steal without getting caught.

## 2. Cash and Wallets

This is an obvious one. Any cash lying around the house is bound to be stolen. Burglars want cash which is why they steal in the first place. So to leave cash lying around the house makes their job a lot easier.

Obvious places like under a mattress are not good places to hide cash. I would recommend getting some sort of save and placing that safe inside a closet or placing it into an attic.

## 3. Illegal and Prescription Drugs

Drugs are another common item that people steal for 2 reasons. The first is that they bring in a good amount of money when sold out on the streets. We see it all the time on the news about the amount of cash that drug dealers have in their home. Having illegal drugs is close to having cash.

The second reason is that people are addicted to illegal drugs but also prescription drugs. They are often stolen from peopleâ€™s houses so that drug addicts can get their fix. These people will also steal other things in order to get cash and buy more drugs.

The best way to hide your prescription drugs is to place them in a safe. This way no one can get to them if they break into your house.

## 4. Guns

Guns being stolen is something that every gun owner fears. The biggest fear is if someone were to get a hold of your gun registered under your name and commit a crime with it.

Convicted felons are not able to buy guns legally themselves. So they either have to buy them off the black market or steal them. This is why they are highly sought after.

## 5. Clothing

Many brand name clothing items can be worth a lot of money. You can look at sneakers [that sell out](https://www.eonline.com/news/1125016/where-to-buy-kanye-west-adidas-yeezy-boost-350-v2-sneakers-before-they-sell-out) within minutes of them being online. This makes them hard to find and worth a lot of money.

Other brand name purses also go for a lot of money. These are items that are easy to steal because they are so small. They can also be resold and hard to be traced down to the original owner. This is what makes clothing so a great item to steal.

## 6. Small Electronics

Iphones, apple watches, tablets, you name it! There are so many small electronic items that can be stolen, wiped clean, and resold for a lot of money. Iphones and other tablets easily sell for hundreds of dollars.

Their small and compact design makes them easy to carry and just about every house has them. This makes them the perfect item to go after.

Luckily, many of these devices have apps you can install to track them down. I would recommend installing these apps in order to find your device if it ever were to be stolen.

## What is the Best Way to Prevent Break-ins?

Hopefully you have a better idea as to what burglars look for when they break into a home. The best way to protect yourself is to have security cameras and a security system. There are many [outside security cameras](/posts/best-battery-powered-security-cameras-for-outdoors) that are affordable and come with apps that you can use on your smartphone.

Having video evidence is going to be one of the best ways to prevent any kind of breakin.
