You can catch someone breaking into your home by setting up security cameras or by having the help of your neighbors look for suspicious activity. All areas are prone to break ins. Most people think that they happen in poorer areas, when in reality they can happen in richer neighborhoods too.

If you have ever had a break in you know how frustrating it can be. Not only are items missing, but many times there has been damage done to the property too. You of course want to find out who did it in order to press charges.

I will cover 3 ways to increase your chances of catching someone who is trying to break into your home.

## 1. Set up outside security cameras

The best way, in my opinion, is to set up security cameras around the house. Many security cameras nowadays have motion sensors built into the lens of the camera. This means that if someone were to walk in front of it that you would be alerted on your smartphone.

Almost all cameras come with this app on your smartphone and you will be able to keep the recording of the person. Video evidence is a great thing to show to the police because it gives them something to work with.

**How much do cameras cost?**

Cameras have come a long way. They are around $300 for a set of 3-4 cameras. They use to be around $700-\$1500 plus you had to pay for someone to install them.

The cameras nowadays are wireless and powered by batteries. This means that anyone can install them easily because you don’t have to run any wires through the house. You simply attach the mount to the house and then attach the camera to the mount and you are all done!

I have a whole article about [the best wireless cameras](/posts/best-battery-powered-security-cameras-for-outdoors) that you can check out.

## 2. Install a home security system

What if you could pay someone to watch your house 24/7 365 days a year for only \$15 a month?

Well you probably couldn’t find a person, but you can [find an alarm system](/posts/simplisafe-review) for that much. That is going to be the next best thing.

If you have an alarm system installed in your house, it will automatically sound the alarm anytime someone tries to get in there. If the alarm goes off then the police get called. This allows for them to rush out to your house and try and catch the person that was trying to get in there.

There are many different options when it comes to alarms. Some are more high tech than others. At the end of the day, all you need is something that can arm each door and window in case someone tries to get in. From there the system will sound off and alert the police.

## 3. Set up a neighborhood watch program

A neighborhood watch program is something that can be easily set up and done to help everyone look out for one another. You can set up a neighborhood watch program but setting up a facebook group for the area and reporting anything suspicious.

If you take charge, your neighbors will be likely to follow since they also want to live in a safe area. If you can have your neighbors spot anything out of the ordinary then there is a great chance that they can give a description to the police if they saw someone trying to breakin to your home.

## How to find out who broke into your house

You can find out who broke into your house by having the police look for fingerprints or collecting DNA samples. If they come out to do a police report then they may want to collect additional evidence to stop the burglar from doing it again.

The steps mentioned above will help catch them in the act. I would recommend looking into one of those steps for the future. However, if someone has already broken in and you don’t have any video of them and none of the neighbors saw them. Then you will want to look for fingerprints and any DNA sample you can get.
