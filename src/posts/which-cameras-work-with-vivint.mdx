**Vivint&#39;s home security protocol does not work with third-party camera equipment. If you are trying to set up a comprehensive security system, you can use Vivint sensors and monitoring devices while simultaneously using a separate camera system. However, you will not be able to pair all of your equipment to the same operating app.**

Vivint&#39;s mission is to make homes smarter, safer, and more energy-efficient by offering a variety of products and services to homeowners. These include security systems, home automation, energy management, and more. Yet, many homeowners are hesitant to invest in expensive Vivint security cameras when they already have existing equipment.

In this guide, we will explore which cameras work with the Vivint security system and discuss how you can use equipment from multiple brands to create an effective and thorough security system.

## How Vivint Home Security Devices Work

Vivint home security devices connect to a central [control panel](https://t.vivint.com/?c=1829&lp=159) that is located in the home. This control panel is connected to a network of sensors and detectors that are placed around the perimeter of the home. These devices work together to detect intrusions and send alerts to the homeowner.

If any of the sensors detect an intruder, the Vivint system can send a notification directly to the homeowner&#39;s mobile device. The homeowner can then access their security cameras from their phone to see if there actually is an intruder before taking action.

This sets Vivint apart from traditional security systems that generally only send notifications to the security company, not the homeowner. With Vivint, homeowners have the power to monitor their own properties rather than wait for a security company to confirm if there is an intruder.

## Which Cameras Work with Vivint?

Security cameras make up an integral part of the Vivint defense system. Without them, you won&#39;t be able to visually monitor your property, leaving your home vulnerable to burglars and intruders. Therefore, no matter how many sensors you have, you&#39;ll still need to install at least one security camera.

The bad news, though, is that the Vivint control panel and mobile app cannot pair with third-party camera equipment. Instead, you&#39;ll have to specifically purchase Vivint brand cameras. This may sound like a setback but Vivint&#39;s camera equipment is some of the best in the market and offers a lot of flexibility.

Their current range of home [security cameras](https://t.vivint.com/?c=1829&lp=159) includes:

- **Doorbell Camera Pro** – An advanced door camera that offers night-vision technology, 2-way audio, video recording, motion sensors, and notifications.
- **Indoor Camera** – A Wi-Fi-compatible motion-sensing camera complete with video recording technology and a high field of view.
- **Outdoor Camera Pro** – A weatherproof exterior camera that offers both daytime and nighttime security.

If an intruder attempts to break into your home or tamper with a camera, it will emit a loud noise to scare away the burglar and send an alert to the 24/7 Vivint security team.

## How to Use Vivint Without Vivint Cameras

Vivint home security is one of the most effective systems on the market but many homeowners are unwilling to spend an arm and a leg on high-tech cameras. If you want to save some money on your home security system but still want to use Vivint&#39;s advanced sensors and motion detectors, there is a way to add cameras without buying more Vivint equipment.

The trick is to use two separate systems. Most home security products only work with their own branded cameras but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t use one company&#39;s cameras while also using another company&#39;s sensors. You just have to set up two home security apps.

To give an example, you could purchase the basic Vivint home security package to cover your doors and windows with advanced monitors and sensors. If a burglar then tries to break into your home, you&#39;ll receive a mobile notification informing you that someone or something has triggered the alarm. From there, you can access a third-party camera system to inspect your home.

[Ring](https://ring.com/collections/all-products) and Nest both offer affordable home security cameras that provide comprehensive coverage for every nook and cranny of your home. They function through their own control systems and also have mobile apps for you to remotely view your property. No matter where you are, simply set up the cameras and access the Vivint and Ring/Nest apps anytime you receive an alert.

## Do Vivint Cameras Work with Other Systems?

Most modern home security systems work through z-wave protocols—a low-power RF protocol used for communication between electronic devices. [Z-wave protocols](https://www.z-wave.com/learn) are generally easier to install, cost less, and offer greater compatibility with other devices. Z-wave technologies also offer better security than some other protocols and can be used in a mesh network.

Despite this high-tech pairing system, most home security systems specifically block off-brand or third-party camera technologies. This means that your Vivint cameras will likely not work with another home security platform. That doesn&#39;t mean that your Vivint equipment is completely useless though.

If you&#39;re currently switching to a new security protocol, you can still use some of your Vivint sensors and home automation devices. You will simply have to add them to the new protocol&#39;s control panel through the mobile app. This may require a drawn-out registration process, so be sure to check with your system&#39;s User Manual.

## What are the Benefits of Using Multiple Systems?

Using two separate security systems can be inefficient and cause more work for the homeowner. However, pairing Vivint technologies with third-party camera equipment can save you a lot of money. Vivint cameras are high-tech and, therefore, cost more so, if you&#39;re trying to cut back on expenses, don&#39;t be afraid to expand your search. You will simply have to set up two mobile apps to monitor your notifications.

## Final Thoughts

Vivint home security is a comprehensive automation and defense system designed to cover every angle of your property. Although Vivint cameras can be quite pricey, you can save some money by using two separate systems. You won&#39;t be able to pair third-party cameras with the Vivint control panel but you can use two different apps on your mobile device.
