**There is always a possibility that any camera can be hacked, but the risk is incredibly low and can be minimized by taking proper security precautions. Vivint cameras are equipped with multiple layers of security, including password protection and encryption, to help protect your home against unauthorized access.**

If you&#39;re a homeowner currently using Vivint security cameras, you may worry that your system could be taken down by hackers. Although this sounds plausible on paper, it&#39;s highly unlikely that your typical burglar could even bypass the built-in security protocols. Therefore, you have nothing to worry about.

In this guide, we&#39;ll briefly explain how hacking works and explore some of the measures Vivint has taken to protect your home&#39;s security system. By the end of this article, you&#39;ll see that, although it _is_ possible, it&#39;s highly improbable that anyone could take your cameras down.

## What Does it Mean to &quot;Hack&quot; Into Something?

In this day and age, something as simple as exploring your friend&#39;s Facebook account after they failed to log out can be tantamount to &#39;hacking&#39;. Yet, this fails to account for what hackers actually do. Hacking is the unauthorized access or manipulation of computer networks and systems, i.e., a direct attack to break into a network.

Hollywood often depicts hackers as bookish nerds aggressively hammering on keyboards but, in real life, hackers use a variety of tools and methods to break into a digital network:

- Using [brute force attacks](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/brute-force-attack) to guess passwords
- Using malware to gain access to systems
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in systems and applications
- Social engineering attacks to trick users into giving up their credentials
- Physical attacks to gain access to systems

The majority of these attacks require the system operator to unknowingly grant access to the network or use concerted effort to break into the system.

## How Does Vivint Protect its Equipment from Hackers?

Vivint security cameras may be designed to protect homeowners but that doesn&#39;t make them 100% secure. With enough effort and know-how, a talented hacker could break into any network. For example, North Korean state-backed hackers were responsible for stealing \$400 million off the blockchain in 2021 alone, while the FBI [currently reports](https://www.reuters.com/world/fbi-says-russian-hackers-scanning-us-energy-systems-pose-current-threat-2022-03-29/) that Russian hackers could directly take down the U.S. power grid.

If such secure networks are at risk, your Vivint security cameras are equally hackable. The thing is, though, no common burglar is going to break into your security system just to access your home. Vivint uses comprehensive protective measures to make it incredibly difficult to access your system&#39;s network. Here&#39;s how:

- **Wireless connection** – Vivint relies on [wireless Internet connections](https://www.insider.com/wi-fi-is-getting-harder-to-hack-wpa-32018-6), meaning a hacker cannot directly tap into your network without first attacking your service provider.
- **Mobile control** – Vivint security devices are managed by a mobile app directly loaded onto your phone. To access the app, you must first sign into your Vivint account using a private password. Unless the hacker has physical access to your phone, they would struggle to access the system control.
- **High-level encryption technology** – All Vivint devices are protected by several layers of [encryption technology](https://itfoundations.com/can-encrypted-data-be-hacked/#:~:text=The%20simple%20answer%20is%20yes,knowledge%20on%20the%20hacker's%20part.). If a hacker attempted to break into your network, they would first have to decode Vivint&#39;s intricate encryption key, which would take years.

For a hacker to bypass these security measures, they would need direct access to your mobile device or have massive amounts of computing power to break through both Vivint&#39;s and your Internet service provider&#39;s encryption technologies.

## How to Protect Your Vivint Security Cameras

Although it&#39;s incredibly unlikely that a hacker will target your Vivint security cameras, there are a few steps you can take to better protect your system. The most likely way a hacker could break into your network is to trick you out of your password. With your password in hand, they could log into your Vivint account and disable your system. Here&#39;s how you can stay safe:

- **Never share your password** – Unless you personally know someone, never share your security system&#39;s password. Vivint employees will only call in the case of an emergency and, even then, you should be careful to verify their identities before giving out account details.
- **Be careful opening suspicious emails** – Hackers often use email to send malware to their targets. If you receive a suspicious email from someone you don&#39;t know, never download its contents. It could plant malware in your phone or laptop, giving a hacker access to your passwords.

Beyond these tips, just use basic common sense. If you suspect someone is tampering with your cameras, call the police. It&#39;s highly unlikely that someone will hack into your system when they could just break the camera.

## Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, any network is hackable—even your Vivint security cameras. That doesn&#39;t mean they are susceptible to an attack, though. Vivint cameras are managed by a remote control center that&#39;s linked through a wireless Internet connection and protected by multiple layers of encryption technology. No common burglar will expend the effort to hack this system.
