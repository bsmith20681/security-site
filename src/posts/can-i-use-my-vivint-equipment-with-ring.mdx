The only Vivint Equipment that will work with Ring is any device that works with z-wave. This means that your thermostat, doorlock, and light switches will work with Ring.

However, your sensors, cameras, and panel will not work with Ring.

This is because Viving sensors, cameras, and panel are proprietary to Vivint. This may come as a disappointment for someone who just bought a Ring system hoping to use it with their Vivint equipment.

Just know that this is a common theme throughout the industry. The same goes for other security companies such as SimpliSafe and Monitronics. Most of the time their cameras are not cross compatible with other companies.

The only security company that can work with Ring is [ADT](https://s24alarms.com/YHSE).

## Which Vivint Products Work with Ring?

Vivint offers a variety of home security and automation devices that provide a similar level of coverage as Ring. Yet, unlike Ring, Vivint allows users to control their air conditioning, access their garage door, and even turn their lights off or on. Thanks to this range of automated options, many consumers are hoping to merge their Ring app and Vivint devices.

Unfortunately, though, not all Vivint products pair with Ring. Ring products sync using a unique system that’s similar to Bluetooth, known as z-wave. [Z-Wave](https://www.z-wave.com/learn) is a wireless communication protocol designed for home automation, specifically to control devices in a smart home or office environment. It uses a low-power radiofrequency to communicate between devices and can be used to control lighting, security systems, thermostats, and other devices.

Currently, only a few Vivint products [pair with Ring’s](https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026250452-Works-With-Ring-Compatible-Devices) z-wave frequencies, including:

- Vivint Doorlock
- Vivint Thermostat
- Vivint Garage Door Opener

Although you may successfully pair Vivint sensors and cameras with your Ring app, you won’t receive notifications or monitoring from the devices.

## How to Pair Vivint Devices with Ring

If you’re trying to merge your home automation and security systems, you may need a z-wave bridge to connect certain devices. However, if you’re just trying to link z-wave compatible Vivint devices, you can do so by following these [easy steps](https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005324006-Understanding-and-Setting-Up-Your-Devices-in-the-Ring-App):

1. Open the Ring mobile app on your phone or tablet and access the “Menu” icon in the top left corner.
2. Pull down the drop menu and select “Devices” from the list of options.
3. Tap the “+” symbol in the bottom right corner to add a new device.
4. Select “Security Devices” to register your Vivint products.
5. Select “Sensors” from the list of options.
6. After selecting “Sensors”, you should see a list of available Ring products. Since you are trying to add a Vivint product, you’ll have to add it manually, so select “Add Manually”.
7. Choose Z-wave from the possible options and then tap “Add” on the next screen.
8. Your Ring app will then enter Learn Mode and begin scanning for available z-wave devices. Follow the prompts to complete this process and register your Vivint technology.
9. As soon as your Ring app registers your device, it should show up in your list of sensors and you’ll be able to use it from your mobile phone.

If your Ring app cannot locate a device, it may lack z-wave compatibility. For more information, please refer to the [User Manual](https://www.manualslib.com/brand/vivint/) provided by the manufacturer.

## Which Vivint Products don’t Work with Ring?

Everything else that isn’t z-wave compatible will not work with Ring. Below is a quick list:

- Vivint Door and Window Sensors
- Vivint Cameras
- Vivint SkyControl panel
- Vivint mobile app

This isn’t uncommon in the industry to see that their cameras don’t work with Ring. Other companies' equipment will fall into the same category.

For example, Simplisafe cameras, sensors, and app will not work with Ring. This is because all those technologies are encrypted in order to prevent hackers from getting into them.

The only other company that I know of that will work with Ring cameras is [ADT](https://s24alarms.com/YHSE).

## Final thoughts

Personally, if I had moved into a house I would simply reactivate the Vivint system. Since you already have the equipment in there you don’t have to worry about a contract.

The monthly price is more, but Vivint comes with additional features such as two way talk through the panel, fire and medical monitoring, and the ability to view the cameras from the panel offline.
